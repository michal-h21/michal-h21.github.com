      <h2 id="about">About</h2>
      <p>I am Michal, a librarian and FOSS developer from Prague, Czechia. I
      have wanted to create a proper homepage for a long time, but I always had
      overly ambitious plans, and I ended up procrastinating on other projects
      instead. As it became evident that I was not going to accomplish all of
      my plans, I decided to create a minimal page and start from there. I will
      gradually add more information and, hopefully, also some articles in the
      future.</p>

      <h3>What is Kodymirus</h3>
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodymirus">Kodymirus</a> was an
      arthropod that lived in the Lower Cambrian period in the area of today's
      Brdy Hills in central Bohemia. It is one of the oldest fossils that can
      be found in the Czech Republic. Why did I choose this name for this site?
      It doesn't have any deep meaning. I just like the Brdy Hills and
      paleontology and found this name amusing. That's all.
